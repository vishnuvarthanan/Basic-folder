          <p class="lead">Wireless speakers are composed of two units: a main speaker unit combining the loudspeaker itself with an RF receiver, and an RF transmitter unit. 
          The transmitter connects to the audio output of any audio devices such as hi-fi equipment, televisions, computers, mp3 players, etc. 
          An RCA plug is normally used to achieve this. The receiver is positioned where the listener wants the sound to be, providing the freedom to move the wireless speakers around without the need of using cables. 
          The receiver/speaker unit generally contains an amplifier to boost the audio signal to the loudspeaker; it is powered either by batteries or by an AC electric outlet. 
          Batteries may last for three to four hours; some wireless speakers operate on rechargeable batteries.
